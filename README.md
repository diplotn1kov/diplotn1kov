### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have an experience in two different fields (electricity and banking).

**In my life**, I follow the rule:

<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="color: black;">Â«The one who keeps going will overcome any obstacleÂ»</strong>
  </blockquote>
</div>

So I'm constantly learning while also not forgetting to improve what I already know.  

**In my work**, I adhere to the rule:

<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <strong style="color: black;">Â«Work smart, not just hardÂ»</strong>
  </blockquote>
</div>

That's why I try to automate most of my decisions.

Progress is my compass. I aim to collaborate with value-driven organizations where I can contribute to shared growth and meaningful innovation.
